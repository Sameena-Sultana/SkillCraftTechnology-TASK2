TASK 2 : Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

TASK OVERVIEW : To perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on a COVID-19 dataset focused on Indian states. The aim is to transform raw, potentially messy data into meaningful insights by identifying patterns, summarizing trends, and visualizing key statistics.

DATASET USED : COVID-19 IN INDIA

 Data Cleaning Tasks:
- Remove or handle missing or null values.
- Standardize inconsistent state names.
- Convert data types where necessary (e.g., ensure numeric columns are not stored as strings).
- Validate that Active Cases + Recovered + Deaths = Total Confirmed cases.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):*
EDA will help in uncovering trends and identifying key insights such as:
- Mortality rate per state (Deaths / Total Confirmed cases).
- Recovery rate analysis.
- Visual comparison of states on Active, Recovered, and Deaths metrics.

 ðŸŽ¯OBJECTIVE:
- Understand how COVID-19 affected different Indian states.
- Inform policy suggestions by identifying high-risk regions.
- Create visuals that support public awareness and government strategy.
- Build foundational skills in data preprocessing and statistical insight extraction.
